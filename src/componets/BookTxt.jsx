            <p>The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic fantasy trilogy that follows the journey of unlikely heroes in a struggle against overwhelming darkness. At its center is Frodo Baggins, a humble hobbit entrusted with the One Ring, a powerful artifact created by the dark lord Sauron to control all life in Middle-earth. Joined by a fellowship of companions—including humans, elves, dwarves, and fellow hobbits—Frodo sets out on a perilous quest to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Along the way, the story explores themes of friendship, sacrifice, courage, and the corrupting power of evil, all set against the backdrop of Tolkien`s richly imagined world filled with languages, lore, and history. Honestly I love this book but have not had time to read it for the past several weeks and its made me really sad</p>
