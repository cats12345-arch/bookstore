                <h2>Weekly Book Club</h2>
                <p>Join us every week for our friendly and engaging Book Club, where readers come together to explore a new book, share ideas, and enjoy great conversation. Whether you`re a lifelong book lover or just getting into reading, our group welcomes all levels of readers and all kinds of perspectives.</p>
                <p>Each week, we read and discuss a selected title from a range of genresâ€”fiction, non-fiction, mystery, memoir, and more. Meetings are casual and relaxed, with a focus on thoughtful discussion and building community through a shared love of books.</p>
                <p>Come for the books, stay for the conversation. We look forward to reading with you!</p>
